 ### 1. Create a Variable using var Keyword and log it to the console
 - Variables declared with var can be redeclared within the same scope without causing an error.

 ```JS copy
    var num = 10;
    console.log(num); // 10
 ```

 **Notes**

- var variables have function scope, meaning they are only accessible within the function they are declared in, or globally if declared outside any function.
- Declarations with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, but not the initializations.

### 2. Create a Variable using let Keyword and log it to the console

- Variables declared with let cannot be redeclared within the same scope, which helps prevent accidental redeclarations and errors.

```JS copy
    let Str = "Hello World";
    console.log(Str); // "Hello World"
```

**Notes**

- let variables are hoisted but not initialized, leading to a "temporal dead zone" where the variable cannot be accessed until the declaration is encountered.
- let variables have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., inside a set of curly braces {}).
- let is a keyword introduced in ES6 for declaring variables in JavaScript

### 3. Create a constant using const Keyword and log it to the console

- Variables declared with const cannot be redeclared within the same scope, helping to prevent accidental redeclarations and potential bugs.

```JS copy
    const bool = true;
    console.log(bool); // True
```

**Notes**

- Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned after their initial assignment. However, if the variable is an object or array, its contents can still be modified.
- const variables have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in (e.g., inside a set of curly braces {}).

### 4. Make variables with different data types and print their type to the console using typeof method

- The typeof operator is used to determine the type of a given variable or expression, returning a string indicating the type.

```JS copy
    let number = 10;
    let string = "hello World";
    let boolean = true;
    let object = {
       name: "Chai",
       key: "code"
    };
    let array = ['Fruits', 'Chai', 'Vegetable'];

    console.log(typeof number);  // number
    console.log(typeof string);  // string
    console.log(typeof boolean); // boolean
    console.log(typeof object);  // object
    console.log(typeof array);   // object (arrays are of type object in JavaScript)
```

**Notes**

- It returns common type strings such as 'number', 'string', 'boolean', 'object', 'function', and 'undefined'.
- Both arrays and objects return 'object', so typeof does not differentiate between them directly.

### 5. Declare a variable using let Keyword and assign it a value and reassign its value

- Variables declared with let can be reassigned new values after their initial declaration.

```JS copy
    let a = "Hello World";
    console.log(a); // "Hello World"
    a = "Hello World 2";
    console.log(a); // "Hello World 2"
```

**Notes**

- Reassignment is subject to the variable's block scope; it can only be reassigned within the same block.
- While reassignment is allowed, let variables cannot be redeclared in the same scope.

### 6: Make a constant using const Keyword and try to reassign the value and Identify the error

- Variables declared with const cannot be reassigned a new value after their initial assignment.

```JS copy
    const a = "js Concepts";
    console.log(a); // "js Concepts"
    a = "JS Concepts & Challenges"; // This line will cause an error
```

**Notes**

- The const keyword provides a constant reference to a value, but for objects and arrays, the contents (properties/elements) can still be modified.
-  Like let, const variables have block scope, meaning they are only accessible within the block they are declared in.

### 7. Demonstrate Hoisting with var
Show how var is hoisted to the top of its scope.

```javascript

console.log(myVar); // undefined
var myVar = "Hoisted!";
console.log(myVar); // "Hoisted!"
```
**Notes**

- Variable declarations with var are hoisted to the top of their scope, but their initializations are not.

**References**

### 8. Create a Function to Demonstrate Scope of let
Demonstrate the difference between block scope and function scope using let.

```javascript

function testScope() {
    let x = "I'm inside the function";
    if (true) {
        let y = "I'm inside the block";
        console.log(y); // "I'm inside the block"
    }
    // console.log(y); // Uncaught ReferenceError: y is not defined
    console.log(x); // "I'm inside the function"
}
testScope();
```
**Notes**

- This example illustrates how let is scoped to the nearest enclosing block, preventing access outside of it.

### 9. Create Variables with Object and Array and Log Their Types
Show how to create and log an object and an array's type.

```javascript

let user = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30
};
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

console.log(typeof user); // "object"
console.log(typeof colors); // "object" (arrays are objects)
```
**Notes**

- Both arrays and objects are identified as "object" type in JavaScript.
